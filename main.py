#yes a better way would to be splitting the file up into two parts so you don't have to wait for the program to trip over itself, but I really don't want to at the moment, if someone else does plase implement it 
#for the gui, the table of values will show
#also, ask teacher for verification if this is going in the right direction
#make recommended to view 7 at once as the actual page changes count, wait crap, it doesn't matter just make it all some large number, like 35 so that it gets a list of all planes, but the user can still decide 

#what this code should hvae been doing is inputting individual words into a database referenced by a tag so it would be easier to find everything, but for the general prupose of this, what we have here, to the extent of my knowledge, is alright.
#also don't tell me that we could be using iatacodes.org becuase real men parse their data from datapages.

#I also don't even know how this is managing to work since there are <td> tags before the ones we need>
#This will break if the user sets a number too high as, the script will think that the data is coming from departures, so there needs to be a set stopping point. The only problem is that I'm having a hard time counting each on that happens, just to note, on the link above, the site shows 17 entries but the html file I downloaded separate from the html downloaded in the code has more than 17. Someone will eventually need to fix that by counting how much there are. WAIT I HAVE FOUND THE CLASS WHICH CONTAINS THIS BUT IT ENDS AT 19 IN CASE ANYONE WANTS TO KNOW
